Transbot end-to-end learning

## Remote Development
Here I will use VS Code for remote development. 
1. make sure the computer/phone and the Transbot are on the same network
2. open a remote host in VS Code, and connect to Transbot by e.g., `ssh jetson@192.168.0.20 -20`, where `jetson` is the username of the Jetson Nano board, `192.168.0.20` is the IP address the robot might have (change to your own), `20` is the ssh port number.
3. type password and that's it.
